\section{Initial Stages}
\begin{itemize}
\item Folder HSE\_BMI\_analysis within DPhil folder. COPIED some things from MPhil R work to this folder. Associated R project and Git, linked to GitHub. Still need to move over raw data and scripts that actually use the data + the functions.
\item Next thing to do: figure out how the standard error bars are actually generated --- what's going on in there? Need to split out the functions of interest to establish this - separate scripts? Some of it is in write.functions.v2 but will also need the original Nielsen commented files (in inputs).
\end{itemize}
